# MusicGenreClassification

Currently researching feautre selection algorithms used in music genre classification. Will be submitted as my final Technical Project as part of the Tonmeister degree (BSc) at the University of Surrey

Researched the use of metaphor-based metaheuristic feature selection algorithms in music genre classification.
Experiments were ran comparing:
* PCA
* ReliefF-SFS
* Self Adaptive Harmony Search (SAHS)
* Binary Cuckoo Search (BCS)
* Binary Dragonfly Algorithm (BDFA)

SAHS, BCS and BDFA were then used to build features sets for binary classifiers e.g. rock vs pop, reggage vs classical
