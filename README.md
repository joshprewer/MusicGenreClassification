# MusicGenreClassification

Researched the use of metaphor-based metaheuristic feature selection algorithms in music genre classification.
Experiments were ran comparing:
* PCA
* ReliefF-SFS
* Self Adaptive Harmony Search (SAHS)
* Binary Cuckoo Search (BCS)
* Binary Dragonfly Algorithm (BDFA)

SAHS, BCS and BDFA were then used to build features sets for binary classifiers e.g. rock vs pop, reggage vs classical
