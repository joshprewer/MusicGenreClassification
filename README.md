# MusicGenreClassification

Currently researching feautre selection algorithms used in music genre classification. Will be submitted as my final Technical Project as part of the Tonmeister degree (BSc) at the University of Surrey

Researched the use of metaphor-based metaheuristic feature selection algorithms in music genre classification. Experiments were ran comparing PCA, ReliefF-SFS and metaheuristics Self Adaptive Harmony Search, Binary Cuckoo Search and Binary Dragonfly Algorithm.

Each algorithm was used to produce a different subset of features.
These features were used to train a SVM classifier.
